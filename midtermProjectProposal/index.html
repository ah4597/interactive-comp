    My idea is creating a similar game to One Step From Eden. It is a mix of a card battler, roguelite, and action roguelike game. Similar games include: Dead cells, Slay the Spire, etc. <br>
    It will have a grid like mechanic that the player will move around in (using WASD), just like in One Step From Eden, and it will be a card battler. <br>
    The player will add cards to their current deck after each battle and will progress through a map. Because I want to keep the scope of this project manageable, it is likely only one or two maps will be implemented. <br><br>
    Below is a screenshot of One Step from Eden. The left side is the player&#39s grid, and the right side is the enemy&#39s grid. You cannot enter the enemy&#39s grid unless you use certain cards, and the objective is to defeat the enemy using the cards in your deck.

    A lot of implementations will be very similar to One Step From Eden, and the artwork won&#39t be nearly as good. But I think this game would be really fun to attempt to make and am looking forward to making it. The artwork won&#39t be nearly as good, and variety won&#39t be nearly as much, since I have to keep the project scope manageable.<br>
    I would implement player leveling, so localStorage API would definitely be used, and many of the other technologies discussed so far in class.
</p>

<p>
    A possible variation I am considering is making it a multiplayer game instead, and instead of traversing through a map to defeat enemies and then a final boss, you play against each other. You would start the game by picking a variety of cards given to you (out of 3 cards, and maybe 20-30 rounds of these 3 cards), then simply fight each other until a winner is determined.<br>
 	If I were to go the multiplayer route, I would likely want to use express for network/server-based communication, and even possibly some sort of database to store user information.
</p>
<p>
    Overall though, a lot of inspiration will be taken from One Step From Eden.

<h3>Update #1</h3>
<p>Not much progress, but the beginning steps are in place: 
    I’ve made the grid, and am currently using an ellipse in place of player art for now. 
    The player can ONLY move on their side of the grid, using WASD. 
    The next steps I will look to implement is ‘attacks’ that cards can use, so I’ll look to implement a computer/dummy to “eat” the attacks during testing. 
    Then will look to implement these attacks into cards. 
    The only challenge I’m experiencing currently is getting player movement to be smooth, as sometimes it’ll double move, or won’t move at all. 
    I think it’s probably because of the way I implemented moving - I’m using a “buffer” every time a key is pressed that I set to 10, and decrease by 1 in every iteration of draw so keys won’t activate too often. 
    Project is still in a very rough, early stage so I will work these out as we go along. <br>
